            <p>When completing this assignemnt you can derive many notable patterns within the given dataset. From the histograms created you can determine that the frequency of visits was mostly between 0.2 and 0.6 with outliers around 0.9. Blood pressure has a wider range that differed with reading showing up mostly under 120 but some outliers around 175 and even above 200. </p>
            <p>When cleaning the dataset, I kept the default function na.omit(). This function successfully cleaned the NA values out of the dataset giving me a usable set of data to use for graphing and analytical purposes. With more complex data I would improvise this approach to not only just check for null values but implement type checking and other stronger validation techniques. </p>
            <p>The overall conclusion that can be drawn from this dataset is that the average blood pressure of a patient is around 102.60. The blood pressure trend found was classified as high if above 95 and low if below 95. Because the dataset is small and made-up we cannot derive any impactful real-world conclusions from this data.  </p>
